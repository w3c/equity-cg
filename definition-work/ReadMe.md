# Definition Work

## Recent Draft Definitions, still evolving

* “equity tax” (akin to disability tax) refers to the time, money, and energy (burdens, barriers, hardships, etc.) that impact an individual’s experience and outcome.
* “…equity means recognizing that we do not all start from the same place and must acknowledge and make adjustments to imbalances. The process is ongoing, requiring us to identify and overcome intentional and unintentional barriers arising from bias or systemic structures.” (https://www.naceweb.org/about-us/equity-definition/)

## Collected Definitions

> “Sameness or equal distribution are the principal denotations of equality.” This aligns with the working definition of accessibility, that those have access. Equity adds “justice, fairness, and impartiality, the principal denotations of equity.” With equity we aim to restore justice. _Source:_ [Merriam-Webster ‘Equity’ and ‘Equality’](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/equality-vs-equity-difference#:~:text=Equity%20refers%20to%20fairness%20or,%E2%80%9Cwomen's%20struggle%20for%20equality.%E2%80%9D)

> "The consistent and systematic, fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of colors; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Definition adapted from Executive Order 13985." _Source:_ [In-Depth Equity Assessment Guide by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dd148f52c519a5bcc4fde76b4932f53b/Intensive-Equity-Assessment.pdf)

> "Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is rooted in the belief that multiple points of view, life experiences, ethnicities, cultures, and belief systems are essential to academic excellence." _Source:_ Syracuse University statement on DEI

> As equity is rooted in "the spirit and the habit of fairness, justness, and right dealing which would regulate the intercourse of men with men,—the rule doing to all others as we desire them to do to us; or as it is expressed by Justinian, 'to live honestly, to harm nobody, to render every man his due [sic]…" it is therefore the synonym of natural right or justice, in this sense its obligation is ethical rather than jural, and its discussion belongs to the sphere of morals.

## From MITRE's Social Justice Platform work, Equity Considerations

> * Diversity asks, "Who's in the room?"
> * Equity responds: "Who is trying to get in the room but can't? Whose presence in the room is under constant threat of erasure?"
> * Inclusion asks, "Has everyone's ideas been heard?"
> * Justice responds, Whose ideas won't be taken as seriously because they aren't in the majority?"
> * Diversity asks, "How many more of [pick any minoritized identity] group do we have this year than last?"
> Equity responds, "What conditions have we created that maintain certain groups as the perpetual majority here?"
> * Diversity celebrates increases in numbers that still reflect minoritized status on [a college] campus and
incremental growth.
> * Equity celebrates reductions in harm, revisions to abusive systems and increases in
> * MITRE supports for people's life chances as reported by those who have been targeted
