## Initial Draft Definitions

From AGWG Equity sub-group work: https://github.com/w3c/silver/wiki/Equity-Framework#definition-description 

* Equity is a process and an outcome.

* “Equality is equal access, while ‘equity’ is equal outcomes.” [Antoinette Carroll, Creative Reaction Lab Founder]

* Merriam-Webster ‘Equity’ and ‘Equality’ - “Sameness or equal distribution are the principal denotations of equality.” This aligns with the working definition of accessibility, that those have access. Equity adds “justice, fairness, and impartiality, the principal denotations of equity.” With equity we aim to restore justice.

## Recent Draft Definitions, still evolving

* “equity tax” (akin to disability tax) refers to the time, money, and energy (burdens, barriers, hardships, etc.) that impact an individual’s experience and outcome.
* “…equity means recognizing that we do not all start from the same place and must acknowledge and make adjustments to imbalances. The process is ongoing, requiring us to identify and overcome intentional and unintentional barriers arising from bias or systemic structures.” (https://www.naceweb.org/about-us/equity-definition/)
